# Timers for Active Learning 

Slide sets with integrated timers for learning activities.


## Download

You can get all timers (30 sec. to 20 minutes) by downloading one of the two files:

* Download the [PowerPoint file](https://github.com/falkr/timers/raw/master/timers.pptx)
* Download the [Keynote file](https://github.com/falkr/timers/raw/master/timers.key)


## Usage

Simply open the files in Keynote or PowerPoint and copy and paste the timers into your slides.
The timers are MPEG4 movies that start as the animation of the slide advances. 
If you switch between slides, timers are reset.
